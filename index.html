    <p>Celty Sturluson is one of the main protagonists of the light novel and anime series Durarara!. She is an Irish fairy called a Dullahan, who came to Japan 20 years prior to the story looking for her missing head, which was stolen by the doctor Shingen Kishitani. She is currently living with Shinra Kishitani, Shingen's son, with whom she is romantically involved and has loved her ever since he was a child. Her motorcycle is a familiar called a Cóiste Bodhar in disguise, which she has named Shooter and whose favoured alternate guise is a headless horse. Online, she is a member of both the Dollars and the Snake Hands. </p>
